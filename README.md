# FS Redux

Pull down the code, npm install and setup a database called `fs-redux-books` w/ the provided `database.sql` file. 

> The starter code has several components & redux setup with TODO's. 
 - There is a `bookList` reducer setup in `index.js` and the `BookList` is setup to map over that as an array.
 - The `BookForm` is already setup w/ `handleChangeFor` and `handleSubmit`, but there is a TODO in the `handleSubmit` for the axios request.
